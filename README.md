# Innov8ion-Odyssey
Hi! this is the team of Innov*ion-Odyssey
In this project we focused on making a decentralised voting app which encounter the issue that challenges in security, blockchain technology choice, identity verification, scalability, accessibility, user experience, regulatory compliance, voter privacy, auditability, and community consensus. These issues are essential to ensure a secure, transparent, and inclusive voting process.
A team of four member where @pranav-1100 worked on frontend , @Sam-wiz worked on creating and deploying the smart contract and @naitikj9 and @Suhassk205 worked on the backend .
We hope you like the idea of encountering the issue.
We have tried to build the whole backend but there are some issues in the dependencies and all the versions of dependencies are not co-relating and it is popping some issues.
have  a nice day!!
